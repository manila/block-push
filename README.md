# Install

**Depends**
- sbcl
- trivial-gamekit

# Objective

Escape the room by pushing blocks around the room to make a path to the exit.

# How to Play

WASD keys for moving around the map

You can only push one block at a time so you will need to use some strategy to escape

# TODO

- Design some challenging maps with progressive difficulty
- Scoring
